Project 1

What kind of movie should we make that has the potential to make the most money?
A Disney Superhero movie that is Sci-fi, Action, and Adventure, over 2 hours long, PG-13, and live-action.

What rating should it have?
R is out of the question and has a very selective audience. If we do animation G or PG would be a good option, keeping it light and family friendly. PG-13 is the most highly profitable over the years and it is a good rating for live action.

Should it be animated or live action?
It could go either way because overall they are about the same trend wise. However, the top grossing for the highest animation movie is lower than a few live action movies. With that consideration live action would be the way to go.

Which production company do we want to go with?
Warner Brothers does sci-fi while Disney does marvel. according to the data and trend of each company we should go with a marvel style superhero movie with Disney.

What genre should it be and what two sub-genres should it be?
Overall, with different charts with the data adventure is the most frequent. The most successful genres are adventure, action, fantasy, and sci-fi. With Star Wars, the lord of the rings, Harry potter, Marvel, spy movies, dystopian movies, and pirates of the Caribbean. The genres for our movie that have the most successful data are fantasy, action, and adventure or sci-fi, action, and adventure. The storyline that these movies produce create interesting worlds beyond wildest dreams, compelling characters, and action scenes that the audience love to see creating high stakes and making it harder for the hero. It also shows good character development and growth. Sci-fi could be easier than fantasy and have a lower budget than trying to create a fantastical world make the movie cost more causing our budget to be higher and not making as much money.

How long should it be?
The trend line over the years shows the movies getting longer and with the higher grossing films have longer run times from the 2-hour mark to around the 3 hour mark.
